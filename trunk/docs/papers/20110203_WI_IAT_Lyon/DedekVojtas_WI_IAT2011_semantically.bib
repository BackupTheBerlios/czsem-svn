    abstract = {{Information extraction (IE) aims to retrieve certain types of information from natural language text by processing them automatically. For example, an IE system might retrieve information about geopolitical indicators of countries from a set of web pages while ignoring other types of information. Ontology-based information extraction (OBIE) has recently emerged as a subfield of information extraction. Here, ontologies - which provide formal and explicit specifications of conceptualizations - play a crucial role in the IE process. Because of the use of ontologies, this field is related to knowledge representation and has the potential to assist the development of the Semantic Web. In this paper, we provide an introduction to ontology-based information extraction and review the details of different OBIE systems developed so far. We attempt to identify a common architecture among these systems and classify them based on different factors, which leads to a better understanding on their operation. We also discuss the implementation details of these systems including the tools used by them and the metrics used to measure their performance. In addition, we attempt to identify the possible future directions for this field. 10.1177/0165551509360123}},

        abstract = {This thesis describes an investigation into the practical use of ontologies for the development of information systems. Ontologies are formal descriptions of shared knowledge in a domain. An ontology can be used as a specification of an information system because it specifies the knowledge that is required for the tasks the information system has to perform. Sharing and reuse of ontologies across different domains and applications can therefore improve information systems design. Ontologies have been a subject for a lot of research carried out in the artificial intelligence community. Although many ontologies have been developed, they fail to demonstrate that ontologies for large and complex domains can be developed that can be used and reused across different applications. There are three reasons for this: (i) many ontologies have not been used to develop a real-life application, (ii) many ontologies have not been reused for different applications in different domains and (iii)many ontologies are merely taxonomies of domain concepts and fail to capture meta-level and tacit background knowledge. }
