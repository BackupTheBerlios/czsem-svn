\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a fuzzy system, which provides a fuzzy
classification of textual web reports. Our approach is based on usage
of third party linguistic analyzers, our previous work on web
information extraction and fuzzy inductive logic programming. Main
contributions are: formal models, publicly available prototype implementation,
extensive evaluation experiments and comparison of our classifier with other
alternatives like decision trees, support vector machines, neural
networks etc.

\section{Introduction}
Big amount of information on the web increases the need of automated processing. Especially machine processing and machine understanding of textual information is very difficult. Crisp methods have their limitations. In this paper we present a fuzzy system, which provides a fuzzy classification of textual web reports.

\end{figure}


Our motivating examples are messages of accident reports on the web (Fig.~\ref{img:message}). We would like to have a tool, which is able to classify such message by a degree of being it a serious accident. 

Our solution is based on information extraction (see the emphasized pieces of information that could be extracted form a report in the Fig.~\ref{img:message}) and on a machine learning procedure that provides rules for fuzzy classification of the reports. Our experiments deal with texts in the Czech language but our method is general and can be used with any structured linguistic representation. In this paper we do not provide many details about the information extraction part of the solution. We concentrate on the classification part.



The main contributions of this paper can be stated as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item formal models for fuzzy classification of information form web reports
	\item prototype implementation of a fuzzy classification system
	\item experimental evaluation of the fuzzy classification system.
\end{itemize}

Our paper is organized as follows: In the section~\ref{sec:related} we introduce some works that are closely related to ours. In section~\ref{sec:models} we develop our models and methods and the design of our system, focusing on the description of linguistic analyzers, inductive logic programming (ILP), fuzzy inductive logic programming (fILP) and several translations of a fuzzy ILP task to crisp ILP. In the section~\ref{sec:prototype_and_experiment} we describe the system prototype implementation, the data and our experiments. In the section~\ref{sec:results} we describe the results of the experiments and compare our methods with other well-known classifiers from machine learning. The section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.



\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related}

There are plenty of systems dealing with text mining and text classification. In \citep{dedek:ReYaLiOntoText08} the authors use ontology modeling to enhance text identification. The authors of \citep{dedek:CAP} use preprocessed data from National Automotive Sampling System and test various soft computing methods to modeling severity of injuries (some hybrid methods showed best performance). Methods of Information Retrieval (IR) are very numerous, with extraction mainly based on key word search and similarities. The Connection of IR and text mining techniques with web information retrieval can be found in Chapter Opinion mining in the book of Bing Liu \citep{dedek:WebDataMining}.

The general schema of our system is in Fig.~\ref{img:schema}. We use our previously developed web information extraction tools based on third party linguistic analyzer (the upper two dashed arrows). The classification is based on a fuzzy ILP and its translation to several crisp ILP tasks. We assume that a small amount of learning data is annotated by a human user.

\subsection{Linguistic Analysis}
In this section we will briefly describe the linguistic tools that
we have used to produce linguistic annotations of texts. 
These tools are being developed in the Institute of Formal
and Applied Linguistics in Prague, Czech Republic. They
are publicly available -- they have been published on a CDROM
under the title PDT 2.0 (\cite{dedek:PDT20_CD} -- first five tools) and in
(\cite{dedek:KlTransformationBasedTectogrammatical2006} -- Tectogrammatical analysis). These tools are used as a
processing chain. At the end of the chain they produce
tectogrammatical \citep{dedek:MiBeAnnotationtectogrammatical2006} dependency trees built up from the text.


\begin{description}
 
	\item[Tool 1.] Segmentation and tokenization consists of tokenization
(dividing the input text into words and punctuation)
and segmentation (dividing a sequences of tokens
into sentences).

	\item[Tool 2.] Morphological analysis assigns all possible lemmas
and morphological tags to particular word forms (word
occurrences) in the text.

	\item[Tool 3.] Morphological tagging consists in selecting a single
pair lemma-tag from all possible alternatives assigned
by the morphological analyzer.

	\item[Tool 4.] Collins' parser -- Czech adaptation. 
Unlike the usual approaches to the description of
English syntax, the Czech syntactic descriptions are
dependency-based, which means, that every edge of
a syntactic tree captures the relation of dependency
between a governor and its dependent node. Collins'
parser gives the most probable parse of a given input
sentence.

	\item[Tool 5.] Analytical function assignment assigns a description
(analytical function -- in linguistic sense) to every edge
in the syntactic (dependency) tree.

	\item[Tool 6.] Tectogrammatical analysis produces linguistic annotation
at the tectogrammatical level, sometimes called
``layer of deep syntax''. An example of a tectogrammatical tree can be seen on
the Fig.~\ref{img:tree}. Annotation of a sentence at this layer
is closer to the meaning of the sentence than its syntactic
annotation and thus information captured at the tectogrammatical
layer is crucial for machine understanding
of natural language \citep{dedek:KlTransformationBasedTectogrammatical2006}.
\end{description}


\subsection{Web Information Extraction}

After the content of a web resource is analyzed by the above mentioned linguistic tools, the output linguistic data is stored in the form of tectogrammatical trees. To achieve our objectives we have to extract information from this representation. 
Here we refer to our previous work \citep{dedek:DeVoComputingaggregations2008,dedek:DeVoLinguisticextraction2008,dedek:DeEcExperimentswith2008}. A long path of tools starting with web crawling and resulting with the extracted structured information has been developed in our previous works. 
In the Fig.~\ref{img:tree} nodes of the tectogrammatical tree are decorated. A piece of information about the damage of 8000 CZK can be found there (the three nodes on the right). We have used ILP to learn rules, which are able to detect these nodes. 
%In this paper we will concentrate on the usage of such extracted information to be able to classify content. 
The extraction process requires a human assistance when annotating the training data.

Note that our method is general and is not limited to Czech and can be used with any structured linguistic representation.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Classical ILP}

In our application we are facing the challenge of induction and/or mining on several places. First we need an inductive procedure when extracting attributes of an accident from web texts. 

Second (the subject of this paper) we need an inductive procedure when trying to explain the degree of seriousness of an accident by the attributes of this accident (the attributes form our background knowledge and we will often refer to them as a background knowledge).
%
The places where induction has to be used have following requirements:


\begin{itemize}
	\item the data and the classification is/can be fuzzy,
	\item in the case of tectogrammatical trees the background knowledge is multirelational.
\end{itemize}

These requirements and our previous experience with fILP led us to chose the fILP as the machine learning inductive technique in our system. To make the paper readable we present a short description of the ILP techniques bellow.
%

A set of examples $E=P\cup N$ is given, where $P$ contains positive and $N$ negative examples, and a background knowledge $B$. The task of ILP is to find a hypothesis $H$ such that 

$$
(\forall e\in P)(B\cup H\models e)
$$
and
$$
(\forall e\in N)(B\cup H\not\models e).
$$
Typically, $E$ consists of ground instances of the target predicate, which has to be classified - in our case accidents. $B$ typically consists of several predicates (relational tables), which describe properties of an object, which is to be classified -- in our case properties of an accident. The background knowledge can contain also some rules. A hypothesis $H$ typically consists of logic programming rules. $H$ added to $B$ entails all positive examples and no negative examples.
%
Main advantage of ILP is its multirelational character, namely $B$ can reside in several relational tables.



\subsection{Fuzzy and GAP induction}

In our presentation of ILP we follow \cite{dzeroski2001:relat_dm} and  \cite{biblio:Muggleton94inductivelogic}, for fILP we follow the paper of T. Horv\'ath and P. Vojt\'a\v s \citep{biblio:FILP} about fuzzy inductive logic programming.

We use the approach of the fuzzy logic in narrow sense developed by J.~Pavelka \citep{biblio:Pavelka} and P. H\'ajek \citep{biblio:Hajek}. Formulas are of the form $\varphi, x$ ($\varphi$ is syntactically the same as in the crisp case), they are graded by a truth value $x\in [0,1]$.
A structure ${\mathcal M}$ consist of a domain $M$ and relations are interpreted fuzzy (we do not consider function symbols here). The evaluation $\left\|\varphi\right\|_{{\mathcal M}}$ of a formula $\varphi$ uses truth functions of many valued connectives (our logic is extensional and/or truth functional). The satisfaction $\models_f$ is defined by
$$
{\mathcal M}\models_f (\varphi, x)\ iff\ \left\|\varphi\right\|_{{\mathcal M}}\ge x.
$$

A fuzzy set of examples ${\mathcal E}:E\longrightarrow [0,1]$ and a fuzzy background knowledge ${\mathcal B}:B\longrightarrow [0,1]$ are given. The task of fILP is to find a fuzzy hypothesis ${\mathcal H}:H\longrightarrow [0,1]$ such that 

$$
(\forall e,f\in E)(\forall {\mathcal M})({\mathcal M}\models_f {\mathcal B}\cup {\mathcal H})
$$
we have
$$
{\mathcal E}(e)>{\mathcal E}(f)\Rightarrow \left\|e\right\|_{{\mathcal M}}\ge \left\|f\right\|_{{\mathcal M}}.
$$
That is, it cannot happen that
$$
{\mathcal E}(e)>{\mathcal E}(f) \wedge \left\|e\right\|_{{\mathcal M}}< \left\|f\right\|_{{\mathcal M}},
$$
or rephrased: if ${\mathcal E}$ is rating $e$ higher than $f$, then it cannot happen that $e$ is rated worse than $f$ in a model of ${\mathcal B}\cup {\mathcal H}$.

Typically, ${\mathcal E}$ consists of ground instances of the target predicate, which are classified in truth degrees -- in our case a degree of seriousness of an accident. ${\mathcal B}$ typically consists of several fuzzy predicates (fuzzy relational tables), which describe properties of an object, which is to be classified -- in our case fuzzy properties of an accident -- a degree of injury, a degree of damage, etc. 
%Background knowledge can contain also some rules, so far only crisp rules are used.
A~hypothesis ${\mathcal H}$ typically consists of a fuzzy logic program, which, when added to ${\mathcal B}$, prevents of misclassification (better can not be declared to be worse, nevertheless can be declared as having the same degree --- for more detailed discussion on this definition of fILP we refer to the paper \citep{biblio:FILP}). Moreover, in practice, we use GAP -- Generalized Annotated Programs, so graded formulas will be sometimes understood as annotated (with crisp connectives and with a more complex annotation of the heads of rules). This is possible, because in \citep{biblio:KLV} we have shown that (some extension of) fuzzy logic programming is equivalent to (some restriction of) generalized annotated programs. 

\subsection{Translation of fuzzy ILP task to several classical ILP tasks}

As far as there is no implementation of fILP or GAP, we have to use a~classical ILP system. Fortunately any fILP task can be translated to several crisp ILP tasks (subject to some rounding and using a finite set of truth values).

Assume that our fuzzy sets take values from a finite set of truth values $T: \{0,1\}\subseteq T\subseteq [0,1]$. For each predicate $p(x)$ in $B$ we add an additional attribute $p(x,t)$ to express the truth value. We construct two crisp background knowledge sets ${\mathcal B}^{raw}_T$ and ${\mathcal B}^{mon}_T$  as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The first (${\mathcal B}^{raw}_T$) is a direct coding of the fuzzy value by an additional attribute:
\\If ${\mathcal B}(p(x))=t,\  t \in T$, then we add $p(x,t)$ to  ${B}^{raw}_T$.
	\item The second (${\mathcal B}^{mon}_T$) is obtained by a process called monotonization:
\\If ${\mathcal B}(p(x))=t,\  t \in T$, then for all $t'\in T,\  t'\le t$ we add $p(x,t')$ to ${B}^{mon}_T$.
\end{itemize}



Also example sets are constructed in two ways.
\begin{itemize}
	\item For all $t\in T$ we create a crisp example set $E_t=P_t\cup N_t$, where 
$$e\in P_t \ \ iff \ \ {\mathcal E}(e)= t$$
and $N_t$ is the rest of $E$.
	\item For all $t\in T$ we create a crisp example set $E_{\ge t}=P_{\ge t}\cup N_{< t}$, where 
$$e\in P_{\ge t} \ \ iff \ \ {\mathcal E}(e)\ge t$$
and $N_t$ is the rest of $E$.
\end{itemize}



These two translation create two ILP tasks, the first is purely crisp and the second can be understood (and translated back to) fILP.

First \textit{raw ILP task} is for each $t\in T$ given by $E_t$ and $B^{raw}_{T}$, as a result we get a set of hypotheses $H_t$.

Second, for each $t\in T$ we create a crisp ILP task $E_{\ge t}, {B}^{mon}_T$ and get a hypothesis $H_{\ge t}$ guaranteeing examples of degree at least $t$. Note that variable boundings in $B$ have no boundings on truth value attribute, which was added to each predicate, and hence there are no variable boundings in $H_{\ge t}$ on truth value attribute. To predicates in $E$ we did not add the additional truth value attribute

Now we sketch the translation of second ILP task to GAP (fILP) rules. Let us assume $C$ is the target predicate in the domain of ${\mathcal E}$. We define ${\mathcal H}$ with domain consisting of one GAP rule $$C(y):u(x_1,\dots,x_m)\leftarrow B_1:x_1 \&\dots\& B_n:x_m,$$
here $B_1:x_1 \&\dots\& B_n:x_m$ is enumeration of all predicates in $B$.

Assume $B_1(y_1,t_1),\dots,B_n(y_n,t_n)$ are some predicates in $B$ (for simplicity enumerated from 1 to $n\le m$). Then for each rule 
$$R=C(y)\Leftarrow B_1(y_1,t_1),\dots,B_n(y_n,t_n)$$
in $H_t$ we give a constraint in definition of $u$ as follows
$$
U_R=u(x_1,\dots,x_m)\ge t \hbox{ if }x_1\ge t_1,\dots,x_n\ge t_n.
$$
Note that $x_{n+1},\dots,x_m$ have no restrictions.

We claim, that if all $H_t$ were correctly learned by an crisp ILP system then for $u$ the minimal solution of all constraints $U_R$ for all $R\in H_t$, for all $t\in T$, the rule
$$
C(y):u(x_1,\dots,x_m)\leftarrow B_1:x_1 \&\dots\& B_n:x_m,
$$
is a correct solution to fuzzy ILP task given by ${\mathcal E}$ and ${\mathcal B}$. Our presentation is here a little bit simplified and we freely switch between fuzzy and GAP programs, which are know to be equivalent, see  \citep{biblio:KLV}.

\section{The system prototype and our experiment} \label{sec:prototype_and_experiment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The main experiment presented in this paper leads to the seriousness classification of an accident presented on a web report, %Our long term goal is extraction of semantic information from web reports. 
which is one of possible utilizations of the extracted information. We use web reports of fire departments of several regions of the Czech Republic. These reports are written in Czech language and can be accessed through the web of General Directorate of the Fire and Rescue Service of the Czech Republic\footnote{\url{http://www.hzscr.cz}}. 
%These reports are rich in information, e.g. where and when an traffic accident occurred, which units helped, how much time it took them to show up on the place of accident, how many people were injured, killed etc.

For our experiment we have selected a collection of 50 web reports. We have identified several features presented in these reports and manually extracted corresponding values. This will be described in more detail in section \ref{sec:features}. To each report we have also assigned a value of overall ranking of seriousness of presented accident, which is the target of the classification. The whole dataset can be downloaded form our Fuzzy ILP classifier's web page\footnote{\url{http://www.ksi.mff.cuni.cz/~dedek/fuzzyILP/}}.

%There are two objectives to do. Fist is the web information extraction, a long path starting with web crawling and resulting with the extracted structured information. Second is the seriousness classification, which utilizes the extracted information. We have made much work on the first (see e.g. %\citep{biblio:DeVoLinguisticextraction2008,biblio:DeVoComputingaggregations2008, biblio:DeEcExperimentswith2008}), in this paper we will concentrate on the second.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Experiment description} \label{sec:experiment_desc}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For the seriousness classification we have used two inductive logic approaches -- Crisp ILP and Fuzzy ILP (as described above). Technically the difference between the approaches consist in different setting of \emph{ILP task}. Both can be done with a classical ILP tool. We have used 
``\emph{A Learning Engine for Proposing Hypotheses}'' (Aleph  v5\footnote{\url{http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/activities/machinelearning/Aleph/}}), which seems very practical to us. It uses quite effective method of \emph{inverse entailment} \citep{biblio:InverseEntailment} and keeps all handy features of a Prolog system (supports YAP and SWI) in its background.

We have compared results of the Crisp and Fuzzy ILP approaches with other classification methods and we could see that the fuzzy approach made better results than the crisp one and also than many other methods. See section \ref{sec:results} for details of the results.

Table \ref{img:attributes_description} summarizes all features (or attributes) that we have obtained from accident reports. Except the attribute \verb+type+ (type of an accident -- \verb+fire+, \verb+car_accident+ and \verb+other+) all the attributes are numerical and so monotonizable. There are cases when the value of an attribute is unknown. We have decided to make evidence of this and keep the values \verb+unknown+ in our knowledge base. A brief explanation of each attribute follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \verb+size+ is a file size of text part of a report.
	\item \verb+damage+ is an amount (in CZK -- Czech Crowns) of summarized damage arisen during an accident.
	\item \verb+dur_minutes+ is time taken to handle an accident.
	\item \verb+fatalities+ and \verb+injuries+ are numbers of fatalities (and injuries) taken by an accident.
	\item \verb+cars+ is number of cars damaged during an accident (especially during car accidents).
	\item \verb+professional_units+ and \verb+amateur_units+ are numbers of fireman units sent for an accident.
	\item \verb+pipes+ is number of  used fire pipes.
	\item \verb+lather+, \verb+aqualung+ and \verb+fan+ (ventilator) indicates whether these devices were used.

Histogram with frequencies of all the values is on the Figure~\ref{img:ranking_histogram}.
We have divided the values into four approximately equipotent groups 
(see in the Fig.~\ref{img:ranking_histogram}) 
and these groups determine the target class attribute in our classification task. 
%and logic rules were learned for each group separately\footnote{We do not have a binary rule, which would return an exact value of the rating, but we have one ``true/false'' rule for each of the four categories.}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data transformation} \label{sec:data_transformation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To use ILP for the classification task we have to translate the input data to the Prolog-like logic representation. As already described in previous sections, the transformations for the crisp and for the fuzzy approach are different. Here we will describe the implementation details about the construction of~crisp and fuzzy knowledge bases and example sets.

For the construction of the crisp example set $E_t$ in our application we encode it in the predicate \texttt{serious\_t}, for the construction of the fuzzy (or monotonized) example set $E_{\ge t}$ we encode it in the predicate \texttt{serious\_atl\_t} in our application, see Fig.~\ref{img:examples}.



For the construction of crisp background knowledge $B^{raw}_{T}$ we use a simple translation of the data to the  predicates (illustrated on the Fig.~\ref{img:crisp_attributes}). 


%\begin{figure}
%\centerline{\includegraphics[width=.8\hsize]{img/examples_nonmonot}}
%\caption{Crisp learning examples.}
%\label{img:examples_nonmonot}
%\end{figure}
%
%\begin{figure}
%\centerline{\includegraphics[width=.9\hsize]{img/examples_monot}}
%\caption{Monotonized learning examples.}
%\label{img:examples_monot}
%\end{figure}
%
For the construction of monotonized background knowledge $B^{mon}_T$ we use rules, here illustrated on predicates \texttt{damage} and \texttt{damage\_atl}, see Fig.~\ref{img:attribute_monotonization}. Here, the first rule deals with \texttt{unknown} values and the second constructs the translation. All the negations we use (Fig.~\ref{img:attribute_monotonization} and Fig.~\ref{img:conversion}) are the standard Prolog \emph{negations as failure}.

Once we have the learning examples and the background knowledge, we can run the ILP inductive learning procedure and obtain learned rules (also called a hypothesis). According to the kind of the ILP task (crisp or monotonized) we obtain corresponding kind (crisp or monotonized) of rules (see e.g. Fig.~\ref{img:rules}). But these rules cannot be used directly to solve the classification task. There are common cases when more then one rule is applicable to a single instance, which should be classified. So we have to select which one to use. For monotonized hypotheses we select the maximum from all the possibilities. It is illustrated on the Fig.~\ref{img:conversion}. For crisp hypotheses there is not such clear criterion, so we simply use the fist applicable rule.

On the other hand in the crisp case there are many instances, which cannot be classified because there is no applicable rule. (In our experiment it was about 51\%
of unclassified instances, see in the next section.) It could be caused by the lack of training data, but the monotonized case does not suffer from this shortage. We can always select the bottom class and -- what is probably more important -- the set of positive training examples is extended by the monotonization.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Fig.~\ref{img:rules} summarizes sets of obtained rules learned from our data: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Crisp hypothesis learned form $E_t$ and $B^{raw}_{T}$ and
	\item Monotonized hypothesis learned form $E_{\ge t}$ and ${B}^{mon}_T$.
\end{itemize}
In both cases learning and testing examples and the background knowledge had their origin in the same data (the same accidents) but they differ in the form of the ILP task (crisp and monotonized).

We have evaluated these two methods and compared them with other learning tools used in data mining. To make the comparison clear and easy to perform, we have implemented an interface between the ILP methods and the Weka data mining software\footnote{\url{http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/}}. The interface makes it possible to use the ILP methods as an ordinary Weka classifier for any\footnote{For the fuzzy ILP method, there is a requirement on the target (class) attribute: it has to be monotonizable (e.g. numeric).} classification task inside the Weka software. Our implementation is publicly available. The data, source codes and an platform independent installer of the Crisp and Fuzzy ILP classifier for Weka can be downloaded form our Fuzzy ILP classifier's web page\footnote{\url{http://www.ksi.mff.cuni.cz/~dedek/fuzzyILP/}}. This makes our experiment repeatable according to the
SIGMOD Experimental Repeatability Requirements \citep{biblio:SIGMODrepeatability}.


For our experiment we used the Weka Experimenter and performed an experiment in which the Crisp and Fuzzy ILP classifiers were compared with additional classifiers:
%Jmenovitì rozhodovací stromy J48 \cite{biblio:J48}, Support vector machine klasifikátor SMO \cite{biblio:SMO} a vícevrstvý perceptron \cite{biblio:bishop-1995}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multilayer Perceptron \citep{biblio:bishop-1995},
	\item Support Vector Machine classifier SMO \citep{biblio:SMO},
	\item J48 decision tree \citep{biblio:J48},
	\item JRip rules \citep{weka:JRip} and
	\item Additive logistic regression LogitBoost \citep{biblio:LogitBoost}.
\end{itemize}
We have evaluated all the methods two times by 10-fold cross validation on our data (section~\ref{sec:experiment_desc}). The obtained results (average values) are described by the graph in the Fig.~\ref{img:graph2x10} and in the Table~\ref{tab:table2x10} (with standard deviations and decorated statistically significant values).

There is no clear winner in our experiment. But we can see that on our data the Fuzzy ILP classifier proved better results than majority of the methods and the results are statistically significant in many cases. Very good results obtained also the LogitBoost. 

The LogitBoost algorithm is described in \cite{biblio:LogitBoost}.
The basic idea of the boosting algorithm is to learn several simple models
on reweighted data and combine their opinions to get the resulting
classification.
In our case, the simple models where decision stamps, i.e. decision trees
with only one nonleaf node.
In each iteration, an optimal decision stamp for each target value is
learned. Then, the training dataset is reweighted in a way that
records badly classified by current model are given higher weight in the
next iteration.
A new record is classified as follows: for each target value, predictions
of its decision stamps are summed up.
The target value with the highest vote wins.

%The Fig.~\ref{img:evaluation} shows the success of these rules on the test data (not used during learning). We have used standard performance measures\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall}} often used in information retrieval. There are also exact numbers of \emph{true positives} TP and \emph{false positives} FP from which the performance measures were computed (with respect to the numbers of all testing examples\footnote{These numbers are written in the Fig.~\ref{img:evaluation} in small frames under each test set label.}).
%
%Naturally monotonized hypotheses $H_{\ge t}$ were tested on monotonized examples $E_{\ge t}$ (double-line frame in the Fig.~\ref{img:rules}) and similarly for the crisp case $H_t, E_t$ (dashed-line frame in the Fig.~\ref{img:rules}).
%%Experiments with $E_t$ and $B^{raw}_{T}$ %Results of experiments with $E_t$ and $B^{raw}_{T}$ 
%%gave following rule set, see Fig.~\ref{img:rules_nonmonot}.
%%Evaluation of learning is depicted in the Fig.~\ref{img:evaluation}.
%%\subsection{Experiments $E_{\ge t}, {B}^{mon}_T$}
%%Evaluation of learning is depicted in the green area of Fig.~\ref{img:evaluation}.
%%\subsection{Evaluation and comparison }
%
%We wanted to compare raw and monotonized learning tasks. As they run on different example sets we had to translate results of one learning (rules with head \texttt{serious\_t}) to results of second learning (rules with head \texttt{serious\_atl\_t}). Logic programming translation rules are depicted on the Fig.~\ref{img:monot2nomon_and_invert}. Here the negation ``\texttt{not(serious\_atl\_3(ID))}'' means a standard Prolog \emph{negation as failure}. 
%
%Then the comparison of both learnings is possible, see the numbers in white areas of Fig.~\ref{img:evaluation}.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this paper we have presented a fuzzy system, which provides a fuzzy classification of textual web reports. Our approach was based on usage of third party linguistic analyzers, our previous work on web information extraction and fuzzy inductive logic programming.

Main contributions are formal models and prototype implementation of the system and evaluation experiments with the Fuzzy ILP classification method.

Experiments have shown better results of fuzzy approach. We see the difference in the fact that monotonization leads to the extension of the learning domain.

%Use of ILP was necessary for multirelational character of extracted data (relational representation of XML like form of PDT2.0 tectogramatical trees). 
%
%System need user assistance: of a skilled user in annotating data for extraction and an unskilled user for classification of a small training example set. This feature is especially important, because in Internet application, we cannot expect an unskilled user to classify a big number of examples
