>
> This article describes some applications of fuzzy logic done by Peter
> Vojtáš and his collaborators and
> inspired by the work of Petr Hájek. I think that it is
> worth publishing as an important reminder that very
> interesting applications can build on Hájek's framework. But, it
> certainly requires some additional
> work. Its formal level is quite bad - typos, missing references
> (e.g. [FSS], [KLV], etc.) strange list of publication of the author
> etc. I propose to modify the title somehow, e.g. to "Fuzzy logic as
> Hájek"s comparative notion of truth and applications in preference
> modeling." I also propose to present less number of applications,
> but in more detail. Maybe the section on fuzzy similarity can be
> omitted or shortened and other sections can be expanded.
