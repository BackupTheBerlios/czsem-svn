Summary:
                             The paper present an experiment in which very interesting tools for processing Czech were utilized. However, the experiment itself is presented rather shortly, no interesting problems connected directly to the chosen task are described. The way of creating extraction rules is also no clear enough, in particular on page 6 a learning procedure is mentioned but no details are given.
As  no evaluation results are given the presented method cannot be compared to other extraction techniques.

Detailed remark: Fig. 2 suggests that the ontology is the final result of the described text processing scheme which is not true.

Summary:
                             At the beginning of the paper - it is not correct to speak about the Prague School of computational linguistics, it would be more precise to mention directly the respective institution, i.e. UFAL at MFF UK. PDT 2.0 is primarily a data resource, specifically annotated text corpus, the tools exist independently and not all of them provide the output automatically. Unfortunately, most of this is said only later, in Sect. 3.
Too many conditionals are used and the paper is, in fact, it is just a proposal more than anything else. More practical results would make it really convincing.
The ideas presented in the paper are interesting but the possible solutions are mainly outlined.


Comments to the author:
             English in the paper would require proofreading by an English native speaker.
