I like the idea of associating semantic annotations to web resources. But I think the approach based on a semantic store is not convincing.

PAPER: 57
TITLE: Web Semantization - a process of automated annotation

OVERALL RATING: -2 (reject)
----------------------- REVIEW --------------------

This paper is about a very important issue for the Semantic Web: the automated annotation of information. The main problem with this paper is that the ideas seems rather naive and not new. There are also many small typos that need to be corrected (e.g., the absence of articles is common throughout: "of increasing (the) degree of," "We use (an) ontology," "uses (the) ILP, etc.) and also same expressions that need to be corrected (for example, "web documents crawled by a crawler).
