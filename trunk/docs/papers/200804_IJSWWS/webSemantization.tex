Introduction :
Here goes the text of the article. Note that the content begins immediately after \texttt{maketitle} and there is no blank line between the title command and the article text. This first section of the article is typically the introduction and, according to APA style, should not bear a section heading.\footnote{That is, there is no ``Introduction'' section.} Subsequent sections, however, are titled according to the psychological conventions.
