Dear Jan Dedek, Alan Eckhardt, and Peter Vojtas,

Thank you for your submission to the 2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Web Intelligence.  On behalf of the WI-2009 Program Committee,
we are very sorry to inform you that your paper (Wr400),
entitled

"Web Semantization -- design and principles"

has not been accepted to the conference.

IEEE/WIC/ACM WI-2008 is a highly selective conference; only
16% of the 343 submissions were accepted as
regular papers and 18% of the submissions were accepted as
short papers. Papers went through a rigorous review process.
Most papers were reviewed by three program committee members.

We hope that you still participate in the conference as we are planning an exciting technical program and social program.
In addition to sessions for presenting accepted papers, we have
WI invited speakers (and IAT invited speakers), two WI-IAT tutorials,
22 WI-IAT workshops, one WI-IAT industry/demo session,
as well as the reception, and banquet. A regular registration will cover
all the events during 4 conference days.

The conference will take place at the University of
Milano Bicocca. The hotel reservation information will be
available shortly at the WI 2009 homepage.

Sincerely yours,

Ricardo Baeza-Yates
Program Chair

Bettina Berendt, Elisa Bertino & Ee-Peng Lim
WI-Track Program Co-chairs

Detailed comments for the authors:
The idea of Web Semantization has been proposed before for Semantization of Legacy Web Services and quite a bit of work has been done.

This paper does not provide evidence that the proposed technique makes any advancement w.r.t. the state of the art. In the result evaluation section a comparison with other approaches should be inserted in order to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed technique.

Detailed comments for the authors:
The paper describes an approach for automatically extracting information from the web using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques. In general the approach is quite relevant and interesting as it provides as means for creating structured knowledge needed for supporting question answering on web contents. The actual work reported, however, seems to be quite preliminary. The experiments are rather examples that the approach might work than actual experiments that show th feasibility on a larger scale.
