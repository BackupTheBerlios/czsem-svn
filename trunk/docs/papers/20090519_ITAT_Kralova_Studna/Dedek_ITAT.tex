\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a survey of web information extraction systems and semantic annotation platforms. The survey is concentrated on the problem of employment of these tools in the process of web semantization. We compare the approaches with our own solutions and propose some future directions in the development of the web semantization idea.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


There exist many extraction tools that can process web pages and produce structured machine understandable data (or information) that corresponds with the content of a web page. This process is often called Web Information Extraction. Most complete recent survey can be found in \cite{biblio:Chang2006} and also in \cite{biblio:WebDataMining}. 

\subsection{The Semantic Web and its Use}

\label{img:SemWebUse}
\end{figure}

The idea of the Semantic Web \cite{biblio:2001-Berners-Lee-SemanticWeb} (World Wide Web dedicated not only to human but also to machine -- software agents) is very well known today. Let us just shortly demonstrate its use with respect to the idea of Web Semantization (see in next section).

The Fig.~\ref{img:SemWebUse} shows a human user using the (semantic) Web in three possible manners: a keyword query, a semantic query and by using a software agent. The difference between the first two manners (keyword and semantic query) can be illustrated with the question: ``Give me a list of the names of E.U. heads of state.'' This example from interesting article \cite{biblio:Horrocks_Onto} by Ian Horrocks shows the big difference between use of a semantic query language instead of keywords. In the semantic case you should be given exactly the list of names you were requesting without having to pore through results of (probably more then one) keyword queries. Of course the user have to know the syntax of the semantic query language or have a special GUI\footnote{Such handy GUI can be found for example in the KIM project \cite{biblio:KIM}.} at hand.

The last and the most important possibility (in the semantic or semantized setting) is to use some (personalized) software agent that is specialized to tasks of some kind like planning a business trip or finding the most optimal choice from all the relevant job offers, flats for rent, cars for sale, etc.

Both the semantic querying and software agents engagement is actually impossible to realize without any kind of adaptation of the web of today in the semantic direction. 

\subsection{Web Semantization}
The idea of Web Semantization consist in gradual enrichment of the current web content as an automated process of third party annotation for making at least a part of today's web more suitable for machine processing and hence enabling it intelligent tools for searching and recommending things on the web (see \cite{biblio:LeeWebThings}).

The most strait forward idea is to fill a semantic repository with some information that is automatically extracted from the web and make it available to software agents so they could access to the web of today in semantic manner (e.g. through semantic search engine).

\subsection{Tasks of Information Extraction}
There are classical tasks of text preprocessing and linguistic analysis like 
\begin{description}
	\item[text extraction] -- e.g from HTML, PDF or DOC,
	\item[tokenization] -- detection of words, spaces, punctuations, etc.,
	\item[segmentation] -- sentence and paragraph detection,
	\item[POS tagging] -- part of speech assignment, often including lemmatization and morphological analysis,
	\item[syntactic analysis] (often called linguistic \emph{parsing}) -- assignment of the grammatical structure to given sentence with respect to given linguistic formalism (e.g. formal grammar),
	\item[coreference resolution] (or \emph{anaphora resolution}) -- resolving what a pronoun, or a noun phrase refers to. These references often cross boundaries of a single sentence.
\end{description}

Besides these classical general applicable tasks, there are further well defined tasks, which are more closely related to the information extraction. These tasks are domain dependent. These tasks were widely developed in the MUC-6 conference 1995 \cite{biblio:MUC6} and considered as semantic evaluation in the first place. These information extraction tasks are:

\begin{description}
	\item[Named Entity Recognition:] This task recognizes and classifies named entities such as persons, locations, date or time expression, or measuring units. More complex patterns may also be recognized as structured entities such as addresses.
	\item[Template Element Construction:] Populates templates describing entities with extracted
roles (or attributes) about one single entity. This task is often performed stepwise sentence by sentence, which results in a huge set of partially filled templates.
	\item[Template Relation Construction:] As each template describes information about one single entity, this tasks identifies semantic relations between entities.
	\item[Template Unification:] Merges multiple elementary templates that are filled with information about identical entities.
	\item[Scenario Template Production:] Fits the results of Template Element Construction and Template Relation Construction into templates describing pre-specified event scenarios (pre-specified ``queries on the extracted data'').
\end{description}

Appelt and Israel \cite{biblio:Appelt-Israel} wrote an excellent tutorial summarizing these traditional IE tasks and systems built on them.


  

\subsection{Information Extraction Benchmarks}

There are several conferences and events concentrated on the support of automatic machine processing and understanding of human language in text form. Different research topics as text (or information) retrieval\footnote{e.g. Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)\\ \url{http://trec.nist.gov/}}, text summarization \footnote{e.g. Document Understanding Conferences\\ \url{http://duc.nist.gov/}} are involved.

On the filed of information extraction, we have to mention the long tradition of the Message Understanding Conference\footnote{Briefly summarized in \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Understanding_Conference}.} \cite{biblio:MUC6} starting in 1987. In 1999 the event of \emph{Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) Evaluation}\footnote{\url{http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/}} started, which is becoming a track in the Text Analysis Conference (TAC)\footnote{\url{http://www.nist.gov/tac}} this year (in 2009).

All these events prepare several specialized datasets together with information extraction tasks and play an important role of information extraction benchmarks.
