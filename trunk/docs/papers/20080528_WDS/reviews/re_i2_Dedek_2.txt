Review on the paper by Dedek

1) Are there new scientific results or ideas or is the review comprehensive ?

I think they are no really new results or ideas; the contribution of the 
paper is the adroit combination of existing tools and ideas.

2) Are the results well described and documented ?

Yes, they are, but an evaluation of the (even initial) results is missing.

3) Are the figures clear and readable (when sized for the publication) ?

Yes, they are.

4) Are all references in the article listed in the reference list ?

Yes, they are.

5) Is the abstract comprehensible, accurate, and summarizes the contents of
the paper ?

Yes, it is.

6) Does the author give proper credit to related work ?

I think so.

7) Comments and notices.

I think in this type of paper a plan of future work should be involved with 
its reasoning but in the proposed paper it is missing almost completely.

I very appreciated the clarity and fidelity of the paper.

As a non-native speaker, I cannot judge the English of the paper properly 
but I did not encounter any serious language mistake.
