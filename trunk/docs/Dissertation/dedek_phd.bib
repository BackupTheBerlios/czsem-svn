    abstract = {We have designed and implemented an information extraction system using a full parser to investigate the plausibility of full analysis of text using general-purpose parser and grammar applied to biomedical domain. We partially solved the problems of full parsing of inefficiency, ambiguity, and low coverage by introducing the preprocessors, and proposed the use of modules that handles partial results of parsing for further improvement. Our approach makes it possible to modularize the system, so that the IE system as a whole becomes easy to be tuned to specific domains, and easy to be maintained and improved by incorporating various techniques of disambiguation, speed up, etc. In preliminary experiment, from 133 argument structures that should be extracted from 97 sentences, we obtained 23\% uniquely and 24\% with ambiguity. And 20\% are extractable from not complete but partial results of full parsing.},

@incollection{Bunescu:DependencyPaths,
    abstract = {Extracting semantic relationships between entities mentioned in text documents is an important task in natural language processing. The various types of relationships that are discovered between mentions of entities can provide useful structured information to a text mining system [1]. Traditionally, the task specifies a predefined set of entity types and relation types that are deemed to be relevant to a potential user and that are likely to occur in a particular text collection. For example, information extraction from newspaper articles is usually concerned with identifying mentions of people, organizations, locations, and extracting useful relations between them. Relevant relation types range from social relationships, to roles that people hold inside an organization, to relations between organizations, to physical locations of people and organizations. Scientific publications in the biomedical domain offer a type of narrative that is very different from the newspaper discourse. A significant effort is currently spent on automatically extracting relevant pieces of information from Medline, an online collection of biomedical abstracts. Proteins, genes, and cells are examples of relevant entities in this task, whereas subcellular localizations and protein-protein interactions are two of the relation types that have received significant attention recently. The inherent difficulty of the relation extraction task is further compounded in the biomedical domain by the relative scarcity of tools able to analyze the corresponding type of narrative. Most existing natural language processing tools, such as tokenizers, sentence segmenters, part-of-speech (POS) taggers, shallow or full parsers are trained on newspaper corpora, and consequently they inccur a loss in accuracy when applied to biomedical literature. Therefore, information extraction systems developed for biological corpora need to be robust to POS or parsing errors, or to give reasonable performance using shallower but more reliable information, such as chunking instead of full parsing.},

    abstract = {{Information extraction (IE) aims to retrieve certain types of information from natural language text by processing them automatically. For example, an IE system might retrieve information about geopolitical indicators of countries from a set of web pages while ignoring other types of information. Ontology-based information extraction (OBIE) has recently emerged as a subfield of information extraction. Here, ontologies - which provide formal and explicit specifications of conceptualizations - play a crucial role in the IE process. Because of the use of ontologies, this field is related to knowledge representation and has the potential to assist the development of the Semantic Web. In this paper, we provide an introduction to ontology-based information extraction and review the details of different OBIE systems developed so far. We attempt to identify a common architecture among these systems and classify them based on different factors, which leads to a better understanding on their operation. We also discuss the implementation details of these systems including the tools used by them and the metrics used to measure their performance. In addition, we attempt to identify the possible future directions for this field. 10.1177/0165551509360123}},

        abstract = {This thesis describes an investigation into the practical use of ontologies for the development of information systems. Ontologies are formal descriptions of shared knowledge in a domain. An ontology can be used as a specification of an information system because it specifies the knowledge that is required for the tasks the information system has to perform. Sharing and reuse of ontologies across different domains and applications can therefore improve information systems design. Ontologies have been a subject for a lot of research carried out in the artificial intelligence community. Although many ontologies have been developed, they fail to demonstrate that ontologies for large and complex domains can be developed that can be used and reused across different applications. There are three reasons for this: (i) many ontologies have not been used to develop a real-life application, (ii) many ontologies have not been reused for different applications in different domains and (iii)many ontologies are merely taxonomies of domain concepts and fail to capture meta-level and tacit background knowledge. }

    abstract = {Many existing rule learning systems are computationally expensive on large noisy datasets. In this paper we evaluate the recently-proposed rule learning algorithm IREP on a large and diverse collection of benchmark problems. We show that while IREP is extremely efficient, it frequently gives error rates higher than those of C4.5 and C4.5rules. We then propose a number of modifications resulting in an algorithm RIPPERk that is very competitive with C4.5rules with respect to error rates, but much more efficient on large samples. RIPPERk obtains error rates lower than or equivalent to C4.5rules on 22 of 37 benchmark problems, scales nearly linearly with the number of training examples, and can efficiently process noisy datasets containing hundreds of thousands of examples. 1 INTRODUCTION Systems that learn sets of rules have a number of desirable properties. Rule sets are relatively easy for people to understand [ Catlett, 1991 ] , and rule learning systems outperform decision tree lear...},

    abstract = {This book provides a solid statistical foundation for neural networks from a pattern recognition perspective. The focus is on the types of neural nets that are most widely used in practical applications, such as the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function networks. Rather than trying to cover many different types of neural networks, Bishop thoroughly covers topics such as density estimation, error functions, parameter optimization algorithms, data pre-processing, and Bayesian methods. All topics are organized well and all mathematical foundations are explained before being applied to neural networks. The text is suitable for a graduate or advanced undergraduate level course on neural networks or for practitioners interested in applying neural networks to real-world problems. The reader is assumed to have the level of math knowledge necessary for an undergraduate science degree. This is the first comprehensive treatment of feed-forward neural networks from the perspective of statistical pattern recognition. After introducing the basic concepts, the book examines techniques for modelling probability density functions and the properties and merits of the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function network models. Also covered are various forms of error functions, principal algorithms for error function minimalization, learning and generalization in neural networks, and Bayesian techniques and their applications. Designed as a text, with over 100 exercises, this fully up-to-date work will benefit anyone involved in the fields of neural computation and pattern recognition.},
