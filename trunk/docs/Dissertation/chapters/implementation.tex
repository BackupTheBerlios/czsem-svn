\subsection{Procedural Extraction Rules} \label{sec:ch50_Procedural_Extraction_Rules} \label{sec:impl_btred_rules}

Our first extraction method, which is based on procedural extraction rules, was implemented using Btred\footnote{See details about Btred in Section~\ref{sec:third_tred}.} API for processing linguistic trees. The extraction rules were implemented in Perl as Btred procedures. Application of these extraction rules on a corpus of linguistic trees is realized such that each procedure (or extraction rule) is executed on every available tree by Btred. 

An example of such extraction rule is in Figure~\ref{lst:btred_rule} and corresponding extraction output on Figure~\ref{fig:btred_xml}. TODO: explain

\subsection{Netgraph Based Extraction Rules} \label{sec:ch50_Netgraph_Based_Extraction_Rules}

Our second extraction method, which is based on Netgraph (see Section~\ref{sec:ch30_netgraph} for details), is implemented in Java. Java was chosen partly because we use the Java implementation of Netgraph client as a library. 



The extraction is implemented as follows: Netgraph implementation is responsible for the evaluation of the Netgraph query part of extraction rules and matching trees are then returned to our implementation, which prepares the extraction output based on the SELECT part of extraction rules.

\subsubsection{Illustration Examples}



Evaluation of the extraction rule from Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_extract_patern} is illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_matching_tree}. Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_matching_tree} shows a linguistic tree matching with the extraction rule. Matching nodes are decorated and labeled by the numbers of corresponding query nodes.



\subsection{Extraction Output} \label{sec:impl_manual_output}

Small pieces of extraction outputs are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:select_xml} (for the extraction rule in Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_extract_patern}) and in Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_results} (for the extraction rule in Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_extract_patern}). 

The former example (Figure~\ref{fig:select_xml}) contains three matches of the extraction rule in three different articles. Each query match is closed in the \verb+<Match>+ element and each contains values of some linguistic attributes closed inside the \verb+<Value>+ elements. Each value comes from some of the nodes of the extraction rule. Name of corresponding query node is saved in the \verb+variable_name+ attribute of the \verb+<Value>+ element.

In the case of the example query, values identified by the variable \verb+action_type+ specify the type of the action. So in the first and third case somebody was injured (\emph{zranit} means to injure in Czech, lines 8 and 28) and in the second case somebody died (\emph{zemřít} means to die in Czech, line 20).

Values identified by \verb+participant+ and \verb+quantity+ contain information about participants of the action. \verb+participant+ serves for specification of the type of the participants and \verb+quantity+ values hold numbers (quantity) of the participants. So in the first action one (\emph{jeden}, line 11) person (\emph{osoba}, line 10) was injured and in the second action two (\emph{dva}, line 22) men (\emph{muž}, line 21) died.

Values identified by \verb+a-negation+ contain the information about a negation of a clause (The presence of negation is indicated by the 11th character of the position-based morphological tag, note that the corresponding node (number 2) of the extraction rule is marked as optional and the restriction on m/tag is put in the form of regular expression on the 11th character.) So we can see that the participant (driver -- \emph{řidič}, line 31) of the last action was \textbf{not} injured (lines 29-30).

The last not described attribute name is \verb+injury_manner+. Corresponding values contain information about the manner of injury of an injury action. So in the first action of the example there was a light injury (\emph{lehký} means light in Czech, line 9).
