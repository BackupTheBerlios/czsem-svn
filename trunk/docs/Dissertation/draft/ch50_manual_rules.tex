\subsection{Presented Extraction Methods}

The main motivation for creating both these methods was an attempt to use deep linguistic analysis of natural language texts. Especially for the Czech language with free word order this seemed reasonable. It is much more straightforward to design extraction rules on the basis of linguistic dependency trees than to struggle with the surface structure of text. In a dependency tree a position of a word is determined by its syntactic (analytical trees) or even semantic role (tectogrammatical trees). So the extraction rules might not be dramatically affected by minor variations (not changing the factual meaning of a sentence) of the word order.


\subsection{Manually Created Rules}
In this chapter the extraction method based on manually created linguistic rules will be described. First of all a data flow schema of the extraction process will be presented. Then several techniques and stages of evolution of the method will demonstrate how this method came to its existence and which decisions stood behind the development and the final implementation. At the end of the section several experiments will be presented to explain the usefulness of the method.

The method was designed as a method for extraction of information from web resources. Thus the extraction process starts on the Web. On the other hand the method was intended to serve the evolution of the Semantic Web so the final goal and destination of the extraction process is the extracted information stored in the form of a semantic web ontology data or more precisely semantic web ontology instance. A schema in Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_ap_schema} splits the process into four steps (phases) among five media types. The schema does not cover the extraction rules design phase; it is assumed that extraction rules were already designed by a human user; Section~\ref{sec:ch50_rules_design} provides details about that. A description of the individual steps follows. 



\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Extraction of text} \\ First of all, target web pages have to be identified, downloaded and text has to be extracted form them. This issue is not studied in the present work. A RSS feed of the fire department web-site was used to identify and download relevant pages and the desired text (see highlighted area in the Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_article}) was extracted by means of a regular expression. The text is an input of the second phase.

\item \emph{Linguistic annotation} \\ In this phase the extracted text is processed by several linguistic tools. The tools analyze the text and produce corresponding set of linguistic dependency trees. There is a rich choice of linguistic tools available (see Section~\ref{sec:ch30_ling_tools}), but in this chapter only PDT based tools were used and the linguistic trees are always of the form of Tectogrammatical trees, but note that the method is general and it is not limited to the PDT presentation of linguistic dependency trees.

\item \emph{Data extraction} \\ The structure of linguistic dependency trees is used for the extraction of relevant structured data form the text. The extraction method used in this phase is the main topic of the present chapter and many details about the method are discuses in next sections.

\item \emph{Semantic representation} \\ Although the output of the previous phase is already of a structured form, it is not necessarily of the form of a semantic web ontology and the output has to be converted to the format of an appropriate ontology for given domain and type of extracted information. This last step of the extraction process represents a logical distinction between two functionally different tasks of the extraction method. The first task represented by the previous (Data extraction) phase is responsible for choosing of ``what’’ should be extracted, while the second task (Semantic representation) should determine what to do with the extracted data or how to formulate the pieces of information discovered by the Data extraction phase. The border between these two tasks is rather vague and they could be merged together, but we thing that the distinction between them can help to understand the problem better.


In the present work only a design of this phase is provided (with a small exception -- using shareable extraction ontologies, see Chapter~\ref{ch:Shareable_Extraction_Ontologies}) because this task seems to be strongly dependent on manual work of human designers and its potential for meaningful scientific investigation seems to be rather small. Details about this step are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ch50_sem_interpret}.
\end{enumerate}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Evolution of the Method}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our first attempt to extract some structured data from linguistically annotated text was done in a standard procedural programming environment (more precisely in Perl, Btred). After an initial phase of development first extraction rule was created as a single executable procedure. This procedure is listed in Listing~\ref{lst:btred_rule}. It clearly demonstrates all drawbacks of the procedural rule design: difficult to read, tedious to create, error prone, graphical or assisted design is impossible. On the other hand this approach has the advantage of the programming language proximity. When a designer designs a procedural extraction rule he or she actually codes it in a procedural programming language and it is easy to add some additional functionality that will be executed and evaluated along with the extraction rule. Thus the designer has the full power of the programming language in hand and he or she can use it inside of the extraction rule. This possibility will be discussed later in the context of semantic interpretation of extracted data.

Dissatisfaction from tedious and time consuming design of procedural extraction rules led to the idea of a special rule language. We were looking for a language that would allow expressing tree patterns and consequent extraction actions of extraction rules. It turned out that the Netgraph query language is very suitable for the first purpose -- expressing tree patterns. An extension of the Netgraph query language to a language for extraction rules was quite simple then. See the details in the next section.

Last two steps in the evolution of the extraction method were (1) creation of machine learning procedure that is capable to learn extraction rules from manually annotated corpus (See Chapter~\ref{ch:ILP_Learning}) and (2) possibility to export extraction rules to a shareable extraction ontology so the extraction rules can be evaluated on a document by an ordinary semantic web reasoner outside of the original extraction tool (See Chapter~\ref{ch:Shareable_Extraction_Ontologies}).

\section{Implementation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Procedural Extraction Rules} \label{sec:ch50_Procedural_Extraction_Rules}

Our first implementation was based on Btred API for processing linguistic trees. The extraction rules were implemented as Perl Btred procedures that were evaluated on all of the trees of an arbitrary corpus by Btred. An example of such extraction rule is in Listing~\ref{lst:btred_rule} and corresponding extraction output on Figure~\ref{fig:btred_xml}.

The second implementation was based on Netgraph -- a linguistic tool used for searching through a syntactically annotated corpus (see Section~\ref{sec:ch30_netgraph} for details). 

Netgraph queries are written in a special query language with a graphical representation. The graphical representation of a query is much better readable than its linear textual representation and in this text we will use the graphical representation only. Examples of a Netgraph queries (in the graphical representation) can be found in Figures \ref{fig:ch50_extract_patern} and \ref{fig:ch50_eenv_extract_patern}. They clearly show the necessary tree structure that has to be present in any matching tree and attribute restrictions are printed beside the corresponding nodes.

The Netgraph based extraction procedure works with extraction rules in a pseudo SQL SELECT form:

\begin{minted}{sql}
SELECT node1_name.attr1_name, node2_name.attr2_name, ... FROM netgraph_query
\end{minted}

where netgraph\_query stands for an arbitrary Netgraph query, node1\_name, node2\_name, etc. stand for individual names of nodes defined in netgraph\_query and attr1\_name, attr2\_name, etc. stand for names of linguistic attributes whose values should be picked out from the corresponding matching tree nodes.

The extraction works as follows: the Netgraph query is evaluated by searching through a corpus of linguistic trees. Matching trees are returned and the desired information defined by the SELECT part of the extraction rule is taken from particular tree nodes and printed to the output.

\subsection{Illustration Examples}

Let us explain it in more detail by using the example of extraction rule from the Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_extract_patern}, which is looking for information about killed and injured people during a (usually car) accident. This rule consists of five nodes. Each node of the rule will match with the corresponding node in each matching tree. So we can investigate the relevant information by reading values of linguistic attributes of matching nodes. We can find out the number (node number 5) and kind (4) of people, which were or were not (2) killed or injured (1) by an accident that is presented in the given sentence. And we can also identify the manner of injury (light or heavy) in the node number 3.

Evaluation of the extraction rule from Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_extract_patern} is illustrated on Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_matching_tree}. Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_matching_tree} shows a linguistic tree matching with the extraction rule. Matching nodes are decorated and labeled by the numbers of corresponding query nodes.


\subsection{Extraction Output}

Small pieces of extraction outputs are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:select_xml} (for the extraction rule in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch50_extract_patern}) and in Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_results} (for the extraction rule in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch50_eenv_extract_patern}). 

The former example (Figure~\ref{fig:select_xml}) contains three matches of the extraction rule in three different articles. Each query match is closed in the \verb+<Match>+ element and each contains values of some linguistic attributes closed inside the \verb+<Value>+ elements. Each value comes from some of the nodes of the extraction rule. Name of corresponding query node is saved in the \verb+variable_name+ attribute of the \verb+<Value>+ element.

In the case of the example query, values identified by the variable \verb+action_type+ specify the type of the action. So in the first and third case somebody was injured (\emph{zranit} means to injure in Czech, lines 8 and 28) and in the second case somebody died (\emph{zemřít} means to die in Czech, line 20).

Values identified by \verb+participant+ and \verb+quantity+ contain information about participants of the action. \verb+participant+ serves for specification of the type of the participants and \verb+quantity+ values hold numbers (quantity) of the participants. So in the first action one (\emph{jeden}, line 11) person (\emph{osoba}, line 10) was injured and in the second action two (\emph{dva}, line 22) men (\emph{muž}, line 21) died.

Values identified by \verb+a-negation+ contain the information about a negation of a clause (The presence of negation is indicated by the 11th character of the position-based morphological tag, note that the corresponding node (number 2) of the extraction rule is marked as optional and the restriction on m/tag is put in the form of regular expression on the 11th character.) So we can see that the participant (driver -- \emph{řidič}, line 31) of the last action was \textbf{not} injured (lines 29-30).

The last not described attribute name is \verb+injury_manner+. Corresponding values contain information about the manner of injury of an injury action. So in the first action of the example there was a light injury (\emph{lehký} means light in Czech, line 9).

\section{Methodology for Rule Designers} \label{sec:ch50_rules_design}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	\centering
		\includegraphics[angle=-90, width=0.5\hsize]{coverge_tuning}
	\caption{Gradual refinement of an extraction rule.}
	\label{fig:ch50_coverge_tuning}
\end{figure}


The process of manual design of extraction rules is heavily dependent on skills and experience of a human designer and fulfillment of the process is quite creative task. In this section we try to pick it up as precisely as possible because we assume that a formal description of this process can help in two ways. First -- a new designer can use it as a cook book and progress more quickly. Second -- it can help with development of tools for assisted rule design. We will concentrate on the Netgraph based extraction rules because we think they are more useful.

The process consists of two parts: construction of a Netgraph query and semantic interpretation of the query. The semantic interpretation part will be discussed in the next section.

One obvious preposition of the procedure is that we have a collection of training texts.
The procedure is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_coverge_tuning} and it starts with frequency analysis of words (their lemmas) occurring in the texts. Especially frequency analysis of verbs is very useful --- meaning of a clause is usually strongly dependent on the meaning of the corresponding verb.

\textbf{Frequency analysis} helps the designer to choose some representative words (\textbf{key-words}) that will be further used for searching the training text collection. Ideal choice of key-words would cover the majority of sentences that express the information we are looking for and it should cover minimal number of the not-intended sentences. An initial choice need not be always sufficient and the process could iterate.

Next step of the procedure consists in \textbf{investigating trees} that are covered by key-words. The designer is examining \textbf{matching trees} --- looking for positions of key-words and their \textbf{neighboring} nodes.

After that the designer can formulate an initial \textbf{Netgraph query} and he or she can compare result of the Netgraph query with the coverage of key-words. Based on this he or she can reformulate the query and gradually refine the query and \textbf{tune the query coverage}.

There are two goals of the query tuning. The first goal is maximization of the relevance of the query. An ideal result is a query that covers all sentences expressing given type of information and no other. The second goal is to involve all important tree-nodes to the query. The second goal is important because the \textbf{complexity of the query} (number of involved nodes) makes it possible to extract more complex information. For example see the query on the Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_extract_patern} --- each node keeps different kind of information.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Semantic Interpretation of Extracted Data} \label{sec:ch50_sem_interpret}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After the designer has successfully formulated the Netgraph query he or she has to supply semantic interpretation of the query. This interpretation expresses how to transform matching nodes of the query (and the available linguistic information connected with the nodes) to the output data.

So far in the description of the implementation of the extraction method the output of the extraction was in the form of although structured but still proprietary XML format. This corresponds to the penultimate stage (raw data) of our data flow schema (Section~\ref{sec:ch50_data_flow}). In this section we will describe details about the last step of the data flow -- semantic representation of extracted data.

First interesting thing is the difference between the output formats of the procedural extraction rules (Section~\ref{sec:ch50_Procedural_Extraction_Rules}, Figure~\ref{fig:btred_xml}) and the Netgraph based extraction rules (Section~\ref{sec:ch50_Netgraph_Based_Extraction_Rules}, Figure~\ref{fig:select_xml}). Apparently the procedural one is closer to the semantics of the extracted data while the Netgraph based one is more general, rather based on the semantics of the extraction process than on the data. The difference is clearly connected with the difference of the design processes of the extraction rules. While Netgraph based rules are designed in a comfortable way using a graphical tool, the procedural rules have to be coded manually in the programming language of Perl. Contrary, during coding of such procedural rule the programmer has great freedom in the design of that rule and he or she can adapt the rule to precisely fit with the data. A designer of a Netgraph based rule has the only freedom in the construction of the Netgraph query and in selection particular query nodes and linguistic attributes that will be printed on the output.

The goal of the semantic extraction and annotation is to output the extracted information in the form of a semantic web ontology. This is not difficult in the case of procedural rules. If the target ontology is selected then the extraction rules can be simply designed to produce the output of that form (Note that semantic web ontologies can be captured in a specific XML format.) In the case of Netgraph based queries the situation is more complex and different solutions can be discovered. All the solutions have one thing in common: additional manual work is necessary. The problem is basically to create a mapping of the data in one format (results of Netgraph based rules) to another format (target ontology). This can be done by a variety of technical means (coded in an arbitrary programming language, XSLT, or using a graphical mapping tool like 
Altova MapForce\footnote{\url{http://www.altova.com/mapforce/xml-mapping.html}}
or
Stylus Studio\footnote{\url{http://www.stylusstudio.com/xsd_to_xsd.html}}
).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



Similar but in a sense different solution is to ground the mapping directly in extraction rules. Instead of creating mapping of the extraction output, extraction rules will contain also the information about the form of the extraction output. Selection of particular query nodes and linguistic attributes for the output will be extended by the specification of how they will be rendered on the output. A graphical representation of such extraction query can look like in Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_semantic_interpretation}. It shows connection between a Netgraph query on the left and an ontology instance on the right. Every node of the query can be translated to the ontology and the translation can be configured. The configurable translations are probably the most interesting part of such extraction queries. The linguistic information on one side has to be converted the ontological information on the other side. Several translation types have to be supported e.g. in Figure\ref{fig:ch50_semantic_interpretation} a translation of numerals to numbers, lexical translation from a source language (Czech), and detection of negation present in a query node are used.

For better illustration Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_instatnces} shows how the extraction output would look like in the semantic case. It is based on the same data as in the Figure~\ref{fig:select_xml}. The presented ontology was designed only for the illustration. Schema of the ontology can be seen in the Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_classes}. It consists of two classes (or concepts): \emph{Incident} and \emph{Participant}. These classes are connected with a relation \emph{hasParticipant}. There are also some data-type properties (\emph{actionType}, \emph{actionManner}, \emph{negation}, \emph{participantType}, \emph{participantQuantity}) to cover the extracted data. 

The last illustration is a SPARQL query (Figure~\ref{fig:sparql_aggregation}) that would display a table of fatalities present in extracted RDF data. The query is based on the previous ontology and it demonstrates possible use of the schema and data.

\section{Experiments and Evaluation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


In this section two experiments with manually created extraction rules will be presented. The first one provides measurements on a higher amount of texts without manual gold standard annotations, while the second experiment was done on a small manually annotated collection. 

\subsection{First Experiment -- Quantitative Evaluation} \label{sec:ch50_quant_experiment}

We evaluated three extraction rules (one procedural and two Netgraph based) on a set of 814 texts of news of several Czech fire departments and measured several statics. All the rules had the same goal: to find numbers of people that died or were injured during an accident. The procedural rule was the same as in Listing~\ref{lst:btred_rule} and the Netgraph based rules correspond with the rule in Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_extract_patern}. The only difference between the Netgraph rules is that in the first case (Netgraph 1) all rule nodes except number 1 (\verb+action_type+) were set as optional, while in the second case (Netgraph 2) also node 4 (participant) was compulsory. This little change caused some interesting effects -- see below. 

Table~\ref{tab:ch50_tab_manual_rules} summarizes some of the statics that were measured. Description of individual values follows.

	\label{tab:ch50_tab_manual_rules}
\end{table}


\begin{description}
	\item[Files]
The same set of 814 files (texts) was used in all the experiments.

	\item[Rule matches]
The presence of optional nodes in a query increases the number of possibilities how a Netgraph query can be matched to a single linguistic tree. An optional node might or might not be marked in the result. The number of possible matches is also increased if there are more compatible nodes in a candidate tree that can be matched with a single query node. This can even be true for the participant query node (4) in the case of Netgraph based rules if a sentence mentions more than one affected person. This can be marked as a mistake in the rule design -- it does not count with such possibility, or it can be taken as a drawback of the current evaluation algorithm of the Netgraph based method -- it should put all the possibilities to the output. Note that this issue does not concern the procedural method, which outputs all the matching participants.

	\item[Unique matched trees]
This number represents the number of unique trees matched by the extraction rule.

	\item[Effective rule matches]
Because the procedural rules and the Netgraph based rules are evaluated in a different way, the way of selection of effective matches (matches that are used for the output) is also different. In the procedural case all matches are used because every such match is tied up with a different verb in a sentence. In this case more matches per sentence (tree) are only possible for complex sentences with more verbs and therefore every match is applicable because it is connected with a different piece of information.\\
In the Netgraph case it is necessary to select the most relevant matches of all possible ones. The first longest (maximum of optional nodes) match for each tree is selected. This is unfortunately not optimal and also not consistent with the procedural case, but it is the easiest option for the implementation (Netgraph can be directly used in that case.)

	\item[Negation, participant, participant quantity (count), action type]
These values represent numbers of matching nodes (or more precisely of pieces of extracted information) of the given type. For example values of participant are the numbers of all participants (node number 4 in the Netgraph based rule) identified by the extraction rule and values of \emph{přežít} (survive) are numbers of matching action type nodes with the value of \emph{přežít} (survive). Note that some postprocessing of the Netgraph based output was necessary to count TRUE and FLASE negation values.

	\item[Participant quantity]
Values in this group are all connected with the quantity kind of information. It expresses the quantity of participants involved in the corresponding incident action. This kind of information is numeric so some numerical calculations can be made (average value, median and maximum value). Again postprocessing of the Netgraph based output was necessary to obtain these values -- in this case translation of seven kinds of numerals to numbers (\emph{jeden} - 1, \emph{dva} - 2, \emph{tři} - 3, \emph{čtyři} - 4, \emph{šest} - 6, \emph{sedm} - 7, \emph{osm} - 8). Note that the vale of average is strongly affected by the very few high numbers present in the results (the values 1 and 2 accounted for more than half of the results.)\\
Values of participant quantity also demonstrate several errors made by the particular extraction rules, see bellow for details.
\end{description}





















\subsubsection{Detected errors}

Results of the extraction were investigated only partly; no formal evaluation is available in this case (except on a small evaluation set, see bellow: the second experiment). About 10-20\% of information was not extracted because of errors of linguistic parsing; majority of the errors was made in long complex sentences, which are known to be difficult for linguistic processing. There was only a few of false positives. A nice example can be traced from the maximum values of participant quantity in Table 99. Three different numbers were found in the three experiments: 27800, 4988 and 333. The number of 27800 is actually a number of chickens that died during one of the accidents. The number was extracted by the first Netgraph based rule because the query node 4 (participant) was marked as optional and omitted during the evaluation. This node normally ensures that the participant is one of: person, man, woman, child, driver, etc.
Numbers 4988 and 333 are both correct. They were both used in the same sentence, which summarized numbers of injured (4988) and killed (333) people during one whole year. Although the sentence was quite complex it was linguistically parsed correctly and also the procedural rule managed to extract both numbers correctly. The Netgraph based rule extracted only the first number in the sentence because the current evaluation algorithm does not allow multiple matches per sentence (see above the comments of rule matches and effective rule matches).


\subsection{Second Experiment -- Qualitative Evaluation}


\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		 & correct & missing & spurious & recall & precision & $F_1$\\
		\hline
		injuries & 3 & 29 & 0 & 0.09 & 1 & 0.17\\
		\hline
		fatalities & 1 & 10 & 0 & 0.09 & 1 & 0.17\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Evaluation of the manually created rule form Figure~\ref{fig:ch50_extract_patern} on the manually annotated dataset.}
	\label{tab:ch50_extract_patern_eval}
\end{table}



In the second experiment a manually annotated collection of 50 fireman news texts was used. Having the extraction rule from the previous experiment and a set of manually annotated texts it is only natural to ask a question about the success of the extraction rule on that collection. Table~\ref{tab:ch50_extract_patern_eval} summarizes the results. These results are far from satisfactory; the recall of 0.09 is something that is far from any acceptable use. Several explanations of the issue can be provided. The extraction rule serves more for a demonstration than for exhausting coverage of all possible cases. The extraction rule looks for particular verb (to injure, to die, etc.) but the information can be also expressed by an adjective (injured driver, death passenger, etc.); another extraction rules should be constructed for these and other cases. The training collection used for the design was also of a different spectrum of texts.



On the other hand this experiment shows how a manually annotated collection contributes to the quality of extraction rules. We can never know if the extraction rule is usable until a formal evaluated is made. Also the fact that the precision is strictly 1 should be noted. This means that the extraction rule made no mistake in those cases when it provided some output.



\subsubsection{Manual Design of Rules Using Training Data Set}  

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		 & correct & missing & spurious & recall & precision & $F_1$\\
		\hline
		manual rules & 5 & 2 & 0 & 0.71 & 1 & 0.83\\
		\hline
		ILP rules & 5 & 2 & 0 & 0.71 & 1 & 0.83\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Evaluation of the manually created rules and ILP learned rules (manually annotated dataset was used for rule design (training half) and evaluation (testing half) -- see the description of the second experiment in text.)}
	\label{tab:ch50_damage_manual_eval}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		 & correct & missing & spurious & recall & precision & $F_1$\\
		\hline
		manual rules & 4 & 1 & 1 & 0.8 & 0.8 & 0.8\\
		\hline
		ILP rules & 4 & 1 & 1 & 0.8 & 0.8 & 0.8\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Cross method comparison of found instances.}
	\label{tab:ch50_damage_cross_method}
\end{table}




Next question that naturally emerges is: How would be the performance if the rules were designed with the support of a manually annotated collection? An additional experiment was made to answer that question. The collection was split into two even parts -- training part and testing part. A manually created rule was designed so that it correctly matched with all annotations of the training part and then it was evaluated on the testing part. For the validity of the experiment it was necessary that the designer did not have any knowledge about the data of the testing part; that is why we used a different extraction task (damage instead of injuries and fatalities).We have also compared the performance of the manually created rule with a rule learned by the ILP machine learning engine (see Chapter~\ref{ch:ILP_Learning}).

The results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:ch50_damage_manual_eval}. Both kinds of rules (manually designed and learned by ILP) performed the same (recall: 0.71, precision: 1); both the methods correctly found 5 instances and they were both unable to find 2 instances. From the cross coverage comparison in 
Table~\ref{tab:ch50_damage_cross_method} it is apparent that the methods agreed on 4 instances and each method was able to discovered one instance that the other did not discover. Such results could be accepted for a practical application but we must not forget the fact that the collection is very small and only single evidence is provided by the experiment, so it dies not provide any statistical significance (getting statistically significant results would require experiments with different datasets, extraction tasks and human designers.)

\section{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Note that in this case we did not concern the annotation aspect of information extraction. Although it is possible to infer an annotation based variety of the presented method, here we did not take it into account because during the development of the method the aim was more to produce structured data from text than to produce annotated documents. In the next section the emphasis will be inverted. 

A deeper evaluation of the method would be definitely interesting, but at the moment the information provided is the only available. There is no real world application of the method outside the academic ground. The method is still waiting for deep testing and further development in an extensive real world project.
