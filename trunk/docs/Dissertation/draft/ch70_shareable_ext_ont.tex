The only way how to use such extraction ontology is within the corresponding extraction tool. It is not necessary to have the ontology in a ``owl or rdf file''. In a sense such extraction ontology is just a configuration file. For example in \citep{springerlink:10.1007/978-3-642-01891-6_5} %[Labsky]
 (and also in \citep{DBLP:conf/er/EmbleyTL02}) the so called extraction ontologies are kept in XML files with a proprietary structure and it is absolutely sufficient, there is no need to treat them differently.







%In time it will turn out if such extraction ontologies are useful or not. But for sure they bring something new that was not possible before.

The problem of extraction ontologies that are not shareable was pointed out in the introduction (Section~\ref{sec:ch70_intro}). 

And this is where the title of the chapter and the present section comes from.

%\subsection{Repeatability}
%
%Our implementation is publicly available -- source codes and the datasets can be downloaded from our project's web-page\footnote{\url{http://czsem.berlios.de/}}, so it should be also possible to repeat the experiment in a sense of  the SIGMOD Experimental Repeatability Requirements \citep{biblio:SIGMODrepeatability}.
