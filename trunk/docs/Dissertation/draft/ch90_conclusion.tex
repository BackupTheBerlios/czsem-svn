\section{Extraction Methods or Classification Methods?}


Our experiments deal with texts in the Czech language but our method is general and it can be used with any structured linguistic representation. 

\section{Repeatability of Experiments} \label{sec:ch90_repeatablity}


Our implementation is publicly available. The data, source codes and a platform-independent installer of the Crisp and Fuzzy ILP classifiers for Weka can be downloaded from our Fuzzy ILP classifier's web page\footnote{\url{http://www.ksi.mff.cuni.cz/~dedek/fuzzyILP/}}. This makes our experiment repeatable according to the
SIGMOD Experimental Repeatability Requirements \citep{biblio:SIGMODrepeatability}.
