The BBC's Bethany Bell in Jerusalem says many people face shortages of food,
medicine and fuel.
Chancellor Alistair Darling says the new longer-term agreement will
guarantee earnings growth for 5.5 million workers and will allow
departments to plan more effectively.
However, the TUC says the government's pay target of 2% has put it on
"a collision course with six million public servants".
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said long term pay deals could be
agreed but only on certain terms.
"The problem is last year we saw the government impose pay deals of
only around 2%. Inflation was running at over 4%, so millions of
public service workers saw themselves facing a real cut in their
living standards," he said.
Police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are in dispute with the
government over the staging of the 2.5% pay rise - in Scotland it was
paid in full.
Thousands of prison staff in England and Wales also walked out in
August over the government's decision to give them their pay rise in
two stages.
Civil servants have also staged industrial action, which could be
repeated, while strikes have been threatened in the NHS and local
government.
Meanwhile, Mr. Brown has urged MPs to limit their own salary rises to
below 2% keep them in line with those of public sector workers.
